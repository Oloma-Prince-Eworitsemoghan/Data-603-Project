## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
boston_data= read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/BostonHousing.csv")
head(boston_data)

```
```{r}
boston_additive = lm(medv~crim+zn+indus+chas+nox+rm+age+dis+rad+tax+ptratio+b+lstat, data= boston_data)
summary(boston_additive)
```
Individual T-test: 

Hypothesis: 


Based off the values indus and age do not seem relevent. 

We will verify utilizing a globabal anova f-test: 
```{r}
boston_additive_dropped = lm(medv~crim+zn+chas+nox+rm+dis+rad+tax+ptratio+b+lstat, data= boston_data)
anova(boston_additive, boston_additive_dropped)

```
Fail to reject null, they are not relevent. 


Comparison Of R^2 and RSE 

Chas is a factor. 


Final Additive Model: 

```{r}
confint(boston_additive_dropped)
```
